- As a user, I want to view three randomly-generated, non-duplicate, images side-by-side on the webpage.
- As a user, I want to select one of the three images to produce 3 new, also non-duplicate, images that are not duplicates of any of the three images that immediately precede them.
- As a developer, I want to track the clicks that each image receives by the user.
- As a developer, I want to track how many times an image is displayed to the user.
- As the developer, after 25 clicks, I want to turn off the event listener and produce the selected images with the number of clicks they received.
- As a user, after 25 selections, I want to view the images I clicked with a corresponding tally of how many times they were selected.
- As a user, I want experience the website as organized, attractive, and easily-to-understand.
